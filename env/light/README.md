# Light env

This is light env is purely for testing the ArgoCD app-of-apps bootstrap
sequence. It gives just enough to be able to check that ArgoCD spins up OK and
is accessible. This is mostly about routing and certificate generation.

This env is not intended for general use over and above this test sequence.
